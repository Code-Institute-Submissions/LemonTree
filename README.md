# LemonTree - The Clean lemonade company.  

In a marketplace saturated with soft drinks & energy drinks full of artificial ingredients,  
we wanted to cut through the noise and provide the consumer with the simplest/ tastiest/ 
most pure water alternative out there. Using healthier drinks to make healthier people.

The idea of this project was to provide our users both consumer and business, with an 
easy access platform to purchase our product as well as discover all the benefits lemonTree has to offer them.

business to local pharmacies and offlicences which provide a range of main brand high in sugar soft drinks.

**Nancy** is a young mother of 4 she lives in a very busy area in southeast london with her husband Ralph and
their two cats Thor and loki. Running a household is a full time job and its made more difficult as she also
works part time as assitant manager of a local brewery. Her kids are all very active, take part in sport and 
often drink energy drinks to replenish after a game/session. As any mother who cares for her children's health 
she wants to make sure her kids aren't taking in energy drinks with too much caffeine or substances that could
be harmful to their development and is unsure about all the ingredients she sees when looking at the labels on
some of the drinks she finds in her local supermarket. She wants something that she can smart her kids into taking
that is both tasty and good for them.
